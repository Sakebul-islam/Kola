## Project Overview

This project aims to create a Community Food Sharing and Surplus Reduction Platform, leveraging technologies like React, Firebase, Node.js, and MongoDB. The platform connects those with excess food to individuals in need, reducing food waste and addressing hunger. Users can easily share, request, and manage food donations, fostering sustainability and community cooperation in the fight against food insecurity.

## Features List of this Project :

1. **User-Friendly Interface:**

   - Create an intuitive and easy-to-navigate platform for a seamless user experience.

2. **Social Impact:**

   - Facilitate connections between individuals with surplus food and those in need, addressing hunger and reducing food waste.

3. **Authentication System:**

   - Implement a secure registration and login system with options for traditional email/password and social logins (Google/Github).

4. **Responsive Homepage:**

   - Design a responsive homepage with a captivating banner/slider showcasing featured foods and additional attractive sections.

5. **Dynamic Food Listings:**

   - Display available foods with essential details such as images, donator information, quantity, pickup location, and expiration date.

6. **Search and Sort Functionality:**

   - Provide users with the ability to search for specific foods by name and sort foods based on expiration date for easy navigation.

7. **Request System:**

   - Enable users to request food items, including a modal with relevant details and an option to add donation money.

8. **Contribution Tracking:**

   - Allow users to manage and track their contributions with private pages for adding, editing, and deleting food listings.

9. **Status Updates:**

   - Implement a status update system for food requests, allowing donors to mark requests as "Delivered" to prevent further requests for the same item.

10. **Notifications and Toasts:**
    - Provide real-time notifications or toasts for users, offering meaningful messages for successful CRUD operations without using browser alerts.
